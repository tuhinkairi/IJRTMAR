              <h3>Aim</h3>
              <p>
                The Journal aims to be an Academic Open Access, Double-Blind
                Peer-Reviewed, Interdisciplinary, Monthly, and Completely
                Refereed Publication Focusing on Engineering and Technology
                Theories, Methodologies, And Applications. It provides original
                study articles and technical notes that have been peer-reviewed
                in all engineering and technology fields. All submitted articles
                must report original, previously unpublished research results,
                whether experimental or theoretical, and will be peer-reviewed
                twice. Papers submitted to the Journal must meet these criteria
                and must not be considered for international journal publication
                elsewhere. Manuscripts must adhere to the Journal's style and
                are subject to review and editing. To provide a platform for
                publishing results and research with a vital empirical
                component, to bridge the significant gap between research and
                practice by encouraging the publication of original, novel,
                industry-relevant research, and to solicit original and
                unpublished research papers based on theoretical or experimental
                works.
